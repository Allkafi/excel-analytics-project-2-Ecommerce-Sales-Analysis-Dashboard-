## Project Insights

- **Sales increased by ~15% YoY**, indicating strong business growth

- **Orders grew by ~25%**, showing strong customer demand  
- **Technology** category contributes the highest profit  
- **Furniture** shows weak profit performance  
- **Top-selling sub-categories:** Tables, Storage, Phones, Copiers  
- **East & Central regions** show strong regional performance  
- Customer **Consumer segment** dominates in most years  
- Profit margin fell by ~31%, requiring operational improvements

## Final Conclusion

The ecommerce business is expanding in terms of sales and order volume, but profit and margins are declining.  
Strategic improvements should focus on:

- Reducing operational costs in low-profit categories  
- Strengthening high-performing product lines (Technology)  
- Region-focused campaigns (East & Central regions)
